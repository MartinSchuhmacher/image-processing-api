# WIP

# This project is taken from an idea of the Udacity Full Stack JavaScript Nanodegree but done outside of it due to hearing about it from a friend.

In general this is my first project with TypeScript and should serve as an API to take images and create resized thumbnail versions of them, simple and dirty. Just take advantage if my code is of any help to you.
